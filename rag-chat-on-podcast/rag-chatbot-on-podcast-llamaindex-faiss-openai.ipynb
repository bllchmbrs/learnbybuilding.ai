    "## What you'll learn in this post\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is going to teach you how to build a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based chatbot on top of a podcast episode. We're going to use several tools to do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) - for orchestrating our data + LLMs\n",
    "- [Faiss](https://faiss.ai/) - for similarity search\n",
    "- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) - as the LLM provider\n",
    "- [Unstructured.IO](https://unstructured.io/) - for unstructured data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result is a pipeline that will allow us to chat with different [latent.space podcasts](https://www.latent.space/podcast).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing the idea\n",
    "\n",
    "There's **so much** great information buried in podcasts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the 'linear' nature of podcasts makes it difficult to extract insights and get information quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This post is going to teach you how to build a chatbot to do just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now... there are a number of different paid / free tools to be able to do this. I've built one called [sniplet](https://sniplet.xyz/). \n",
    "\n",
    "These kinds of applications make for a GREAT project for learning that's because they're going to show us how to wire together...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple data pipelines on unstructured data\n",
    "- building chat and query models\n",
    "- leveraging semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to help you better understand how to build these kinds of tools. They are not magic. We're just entering this wave of AI enabled applications that we, as developers, need to know how to build these things! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get right to it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### and what is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous post, we [built a RAG application from scratch](https://learnbybuilding.ai/tutorials/rag-from-scratch). That tutorial used 0 libraries to walk through the key concepts of RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a formal definition, you should refer to the website and the paper but for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gist of the technique is to add your own data (via some retrieval tool) into the prompt that you pass into a large language model. With that, you get a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "That gives you several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can include facts in the prompt to help the LLM avoid hallucinations\n",
    "2. You can (manually) refer to sources of truth when responding to a user query, helping to double check any potential issues.\n",
    "3. You can leverage data that the LLM might not have been trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the visual learners, here's a simple diagram of a RAG query. We pull data from a database, combine that with the user query and other information into a prompt and pass that into the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The basics of a RAG query](images/anatomy-of-a-rag-query.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The podcast we'll be working with\n",
    "\n",
    "We've got [a podcast \"RAG Is A Hack\"](https://www.latent.space/p/llamaindex) with Jerry Liu ([twitter](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-liu-64390071/)) on [the Latent Space podcast](https://www.latent.space/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What better way to explore RAG than by building a RAG-based chatbot on a podcast about RAG about a tool that provides tools for building RAG applications?**\n",
    "\n",
    "What's nice about this podcast is that transcripts are INCLUDED. That means that it's easy to access the written text of the podcast. In future episodes, we'll explore getting transcripts for podcasts that don't publish transcripts but doing so is beyond the scope of this particular tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptually, what are the steps to build our application?\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fetch the atom feed\n",
    "2. Parse that feed into something useful\n",
    "3. Look up a particular episode\n",
    "4. Get the (provided) transcript for that particular episode\n",
    "5. Index that particular transcript into a Vector Index for querying\n",

    "\n",
    "Alright, let's take a pause to explain the basics. As you (hopefully) read in our [Building a RAG Application from Scratch](https://learnbybuilding.ai/posts/rag-from-scratch) post, we're going to want to do more than just search based on keywords in the transcripts. What we want to do, and what makes generative AI so exciting in some sense, is the fact that we can search by **semantics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hold up, what are semantics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantics are the *meaning* of a word, as opposed to just the collection of characters that we see on a screen on paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example:\n",
    "- \"It's cold outside\"\n",
    "- \"He was cold to me\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`Cold` in both of these sentences is the same word. But semantically it's different. In the first it describes temperature, in the second it describes a feeling. There are different definitions and semantics for \"cold\". Common keyword (hash-based) search wouldn't understand that but semantic search does.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Back to the topic: embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've understood semantics, we can get to embeddings. Embeddings are, in simplest terms, an easy way to convert words into numbers. The numbers that we convert text into represent a vector. The distiance between two vectors represents their similarity (small distance) or difference (large distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use [an embedding provided by OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) for this tutorial but there is a MASSIVE world of embeddings and this is an active area of research that has legs.\n",
    "\n",
