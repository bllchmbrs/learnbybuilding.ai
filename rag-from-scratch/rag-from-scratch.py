# # Building a RAG Application from Scratch
# 
# All these vendors are trying to overcomplicate retrieval augmented generation (RAG). They're trying to inject different tools all over the place and make it more complicated than it needs to be. Let's change that.
# 
# This tutorial is going to teach you how to build RAG applications from scratch. No fluff, no jargon, no libraries, just a simple step by step RAG application.
# 
# Let's get started!
# 
# ## The High Level Components of a RAG System
# 
# 1. a collection of documents (formally called a corpus)
# 2. An input from the user
# 3. a similarity measure between the collection of documents and the user input
# 
# Yes, it's that simple. 
# 
# You don't need a vector store, you don't even *need* an LLM. Everyone is trying to make it so complicated. It's not.
# 
# ## The ordered steps of a RAG system
# 
# We'll perform the following steps in sequence.
# 
# 1. Receive a user input
# 2. Perform our similarity measure
# 3. Post-process the user input and the fetched document(s).
# 
# The post-processing is done with an LLM.
# 
# ## A note from the paper itself
# 
# The actual RAG paper is obviously *the* resource. The problem is that it assumes a LOT of context. It's more complicated than we need it to be.
# 
# For instance, here's the overview of the RAG system as proposed in the paper.
# 
# ![retrieval augmented generation data and user flow](images/rag-paper-image.png)
# 
# That's dense. It's great for researchers but for the rest of us, it's going to be a lot easier to learn step by step by building the system ourselves.
# 
# ## Working through an example - the simplest RAG system
# 
# Let's get back to building RAG from scratch, step by step. Here's the simplified version we'll be working through.
# 
# ![simple retrieval in RAG system](images/the-simplest-retrieval-augmented-generation-system.jpg)
# 
# ### Getting a collection of documents
# 
# Below you can see that we've got a simple corpus of 'documents' (please be generous ðŸ˜‰).

# In[1]:


corpus_of_documents = [
    "Take a leisurely walk in the park and enjoy the fresh air.",
    "Visit a local museum and discover something new.",
    "Attend a live music concert and feel the rhythm.",
    "Go for a hike and admire the natural scenery.",
    "Have a picnic with friends and share some laughs.",
    "Explore a new cuisine by dining at an ethnic restaurant.",
    "Take a yoga class and stretch your body and mind.",
    "Join a local sports league and enjoy some friendly competition.",
    "Attend a workshop or lecture on a topic you're interested in.",
    "Visit an amusement park and ride the roller coasters."
]


# ### Defining and performing the similarity measure
# 
# Now we need a way of measuring the similarity between the **user input** we're going to receive and the **collection** of documents that we organized. Arguably the simplest similarity measure is [jaccard similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). I've written about that in the past (see [this post](https://billchambers.me/posts/tf-idf-explained-in-python) but the short answer is that the **jaccard similarity** is the intersection divided by the union of the "sets" of words.
# 
# This allows us to compare our user input with the source documents.
# 
# #### Side note: preprocessing
# 
# A challenge is that if we have a plain string like `"Take a leisurely walk in the park and enjoy the fresh air.",`, we're going to have to pre-process that into a set, so that we can perform these comparisons. We're going to do this in the simplest way possible, lower case and split by `" "`.

# In[2]:


def jaccard_similarity(query, document):
    query = query.lower().split(" ")
    document = document.lower().split(" ")
    intersection = set(query).intersection(set(document))
    union = set(query).union(set(document))
    return len(intersection)/len(union)


# Now we need to define a function that takes in the exact query and our corpus and selects the 'best' document to return to the user.

# In[3]:


def return_response(query, corpus):
    similarities = []
    for doc in corpus:
        similarity = jaccard_similarity(user_input, doc)
        similarities.append(similarity)
    return corpus_of_documents[similarities.index(max(similarities))]


# Now we can run it, we'll start with a simple prompt.

# In[4]:


user_prompt = "What is a leisure activity that you like?"


# And a simple user input...

# In[5]:


user_input = "I like to hike"


# Now we can return our response.

# In[6]:


return_response(user_input, corpus_of_documents)


# Congrats, you've built a basic RAG application.
# 
# 
# #### I got 99 problems and bad similarity is one
# 
# Now we've opted for a simple similarity measure for learning. But this is going to be problematic because it's so simple. It has no notion of **semantics**. It's just looks at what words are in both documents. That means that if we provide a negative example, we're going to get the same "result" because that's the closest document.
# 
# ![Bad Similarity Problems in Retrieval Augmented Generation](images/a-key-challenge-of-retrieval-augmented-generation-systems-semantics.jpg)

# In[7]:


user_input = "I don't like to hike"


# In[8]:


return_response(user_input, corpus_of_documents)


# This is a topic that's going to come up a lot with "RAG", but for now, rest assured that we'll address this problem later.
# 
# At this point, we've done zero post processing of the "document" that we're responding to. So we've really only done the "retrieval" part of "Retrieval-Augmented Generation". Let's get to augmented generation by adding a large language model (LLM).

# ## Adding in a LLM
# 
# To do this, we're going to use [ollama](https://ollama.ai/) to get up and running with an open source LLM on our local machine. We could just as easily use OpenAI's gpt-4 or Anthropic's Claude but for now, we'll start with the open source llama2 from [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/llama/).
# 
# - [ollama installation instructions are here](https://ollama.ai/)
# 
# This post is going to assume some basic knowledge of large language models, so let's get right to querying this model.

# In[9]:


import requests
import json


# First we're going to define the inputs. To work with this model, we're going to take 
# 
# 1. user input,
# 2. fetch the most similar document (as measured by our similarity measure),
# 3. pass that into a prompt to the language model,
# 4. *then* return the result to the user
# 
# That introduces a new term, the **prompt**. In short, it's the instructions that you provide to the LLM.
# 
# When you run this code, you'll see the streaming result. Streaming is important for user experience.

# In[10]:


user_input = "I like to hike"
relevant_document = return_response(user_input, corpus_of_documents)
full_response = []

# https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md

prompt = """
You are a helpful bot that makes recommendations for activities. You are helpful.

This is the recommended activity: {relevant_document}

The user input is: {user_input}

Compile a recommendation to the user based on the recommended activity and the user input.
"""


# Now that we've defined that, let's make the API call to ollama (and llama2).
# 
# an important step is to make sure that ollama's running already on your local machine by running `ollama serve` (crazy, I know).

# In[11]:


url = 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate'
data = {
    "model": "llama2",
    "prompt": prompt.format(user_input=user_input, relevant_document=relevant_document)
}

headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers, stream=True)

try:
    for line in response.iter_lines():
        # filter out keep-alive new lines
        if line:
            decoded_line = json.loads(line.decode('utf-8'))
            # print(decoded_line['response']) # uncomment to results, token by token
            full_response.append(decoded_line['response'])
finally:
    response.close()
print(''.join(full_response))


# This gives us a complete RAG Application, from scratch, no providers, no services. You know all of the components in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation application. Visually, here's what we've built.
# 
# ![simplified version of retrieval augmented generation](images/simplified-version-of-retrieval-augmented-generation.jpg)
# 
# The LLM (if you're lucky) will handle the user input that goes against the recommended document. We can see that below.

# In[12]:


user_input = "I don't like to hike"
relevant_document = return_response(user_input, corpus_of_documents)
# https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md
full_response = []

prompt = """
You are a helpful bot that makes recommendations for activities. You are helpful.

This is the recommended activity: {relevant_document}

The user input is: {user_input}

Compile a recommendation to the user based on the recommended activity and the user input.
"""

url = 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate'
data = {
    "model": "llama2",
    "prompt": prompt.format(user_input=user_input, relevant_document=relevant_document)
}

headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers, stream=True)

try:
    for line in response.iter_lines():
        # filter out keep-alive new lines
        if line:
            decoded_line = json.loads(line.decode('utf-8'))
            # print(decoded_line['response'])  # uncomment to results, token by token
            full_response.append(decoded_line['response'])
finally:
    response.close()
print(''.join(full_response))


# ## Areas for improvement
# 
# If we go back to our diagream of the RAG application and think about what we've just built, we'll see various opportunities for improvement. These opportunities are where tools like vector stores, embeddings, and prompt 'engineering' gets involved.
# 
# Here are 10 potential areas for improvement:
# 
# 1. **The number of documents** ðŸ‘‰ more documents might mean more recommendations.
# 2. **The depth/size of documents** ðŸ‘‰ higher quality content and longer documents with more information might be better.
# 3. **The number of documents we give to the LLM** ðŸ‘‰ Right now, we're only giving the LLM one document. We could feed in several as 'context' and allow the model to provide a more personalized recommendation based on the user input.
# 4. **The parts of documents that we give to the LLM** ðŸ‘‰ If we have bigger or more thorough documents, we might just want to add in parts of those documents, parts of various documents, or some variation there of. In the lexicon, this is called chunking.
# 5. **Our document storage tool** ðŸ‘‰ We might store our documents in a different way or different database. In particular, if we have a lot of documents, we might explore storing them in a data lake or a vector store.
# 6. **The similarity measure** How we measure similarity is of consequence, we might need to trade off performance and thoroughness (e.g., looking at every individual document).
# 7. **The pre-processing of the documents & user input** ðŸ‘‰ We might perform some extra preprocessing or augmentation of the user input before we pass it into the similarity measure. For instance, we might use an embedding to convert that input to a vector.
# 8. **The similarity measure** ðŸ‘‰ We can change the similarity measure to fetch better or more relevant documents.
# 9. **The model** ðŸ‘‰ We can change the final model that we use. We're using llama2 above, but we could just as easily use an Anthropic or Claude Model.
# 10. **The prompt** ðŸ‘‰ We could use a different prompt into the LLM/Model and tune it according to the output we want to get the output we want.
# 11. **If you're worried about harmful or toxic output** ðŸ‘‰ We could implement a "circuit breaker" of sorts that runs the user input to see if there's toxic, harmful, or dangerous discussions. For instance, in a healthcare context you could see if the information contained unsafe languages and respond accordingly - outside of the typical flow.
# 
# 
# Now improvements don't stop here. They're quite limitless and that's what we'll get into in the future. Until then, [let me know if you have any questions on twitter](https://twitter.com/bllchmbrs) and happy RAGING :).
