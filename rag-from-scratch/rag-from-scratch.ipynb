    "# A beginner's guide to building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, is all the rage these days because it introduces some serious capabilities to large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 - and that's the ability to use and leverage their own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem with learning in a fast moving space\n",
    "\n",
    "There's so much noise in the AI space and in particular about RAG. Vendors are trying to overcomplicate it. They're trying to inject their tools, their ecosystems, their vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's making RAG, way more complicated than it needs to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is going to teach you how to build RAG applications from scratch. This tutorials is oriented towards beginners to help them learn and get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "No fluff, no (ok, minimal) jargon, no libraries, just a simple step by step RAG application.\n",

    "[Jerry from LlamaIndex advocates for building things from scratch to really understand the pieces](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1716122650836439478). Once you do, using a library like LlamaIndex makes more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jerry from LlamaIndex advocating for RAG from scratch](images/motivating-rag-from-scratch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Build from scratch to learn, then build with libraries to scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing our concept: Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "You may or may not have heard of Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the definition from [the blog post introducing the concept from Facebook](https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Building a model that researches and contextualizes is more challenging, but it's essential for future advancements. We recently made substantial progress in this realm with our Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, an end-to-end differentiable model that combines an information retrieval component (Facebook AIâ€™s dense-passage retrieval system) with a seq2seq generator (our Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers [BART] model). RAG can be fine-tuned on knowledge-intensive downstream tasks to achieve state-of-the-art results compared with even the largest pretrained seq2seq language models. And unlike these pretrained models, RAGâ€™s internal knowledge can be easily altered or even supplemented on the fly, enabling researchers and engineers to control what RAG knows and doesnâ€™t know without wasting time or compute power retraining the entire model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow, that's a mouthful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's simplify things, since we're just getting started. The gist of the technique is to add your own data (via some retrieval tool) into the prompt that you pass into a large language model. With that, you get a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "That gives you several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can include facts in the prompt to help the LLM avoid hallucinations\n",
    "2. You can (manually) refer to sources of truth when responding to a user query, helping to double check any potential issues.\n",
    "3. You can leverage data that the LLM might not have been trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The High Level Components of our RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a collection of documents (formally called a corpus)\n",
    "2. An input from the user\n",
    "3. a similarity measure between the collection of documents and the user input\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it's that simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start learning and understanding RAG based systems, you don't need a vector store, you don't even *need* an LLM (at least to learn and understand conceptually). \n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone is trying to make it so complicated. It's not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The ordered steps of a querying RAG system\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll perform the following steps in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Receive a user input\n",
    "2. Perform our similarity measure\n",
    "3. Post-process the user input and the fetched document(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "The post-processing is done with an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A note from the paper itself\n",
    "\n",
    "[The actual RAG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) is obviously *the* resource. The problem is that it assumes a LOT of context. It's more complicated than we need it to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, here's the overview of the RAG system as proposed in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "![retrieval augmented generation data and user flow](images/rag-paper-image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That's dense. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's great for researchers but for the rest of us, it's going to be a lot easier to learn step by step by building the system ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working through an example - the simplest RAG system\n",
    "\n",

    "3. **The number of documents we give to the LLM** ðŸ‘‰ Right now, we're only giving the LLM one document. We could feed in several as 'context' and allow the model to provide a more personalized recommendation based on the user input.\n",
    "4. **The parts of documents that we give to the LLM** ðŸ‘‰ If we have bigger or more thorough documents, we might just want to add in parts of those documents, parts of various documents, or some variation there of. In the lexicon, this is called chunking.\n",
    "5. **Our document storage tool** ðŸ‘‰ We might store our documents in a different way or different database. In particular, if we have a lot of documents, we might explore storing them in a data lake or a vector store.\n",
    "6. **The similarity measure** ðŸ‘‰ How we measure similarity is of consequence, we might need to trade off performance and thoroughness (e.g., looking at every individual document).\n",
    "7. **The pre-processing of the documents & user input** ðŸ‘‰ We might perform some extra preprocessing or augmentation of the user input before we pass it into the similarity measure. For instance, we might use an embedding to convert that input to a vector.\n",
    "8. **The similarity measure** ðŸ‘‰ We can change the similarity measure to fetch better or more relevant documents.\n",
    "9. **The model** ðŸ‘‰ We can change the final model that we use. We're using llama2 above, but we could just as easily use an Anthropic or Claude Model.\n",
    "10. **The prompt** ðŸ‘‰ We could use a different prompt into the LLM/Model and tune it according to the output we want to get the output we want.\n",
    "11. **If you're worried about harmful or toxic output** ðŸ‘‰ We could implement a \"circuit breaker\" of sorts that runs the user input to see if there's toxic, harmful, or dangerous discussions. For instance, in a healthcare context you could see if the information contained unsafe languages and respond accordingly - outside of the typical flow.\n",

    "Now improvements don't stop here. They're quite limitless and that's what we'll get into in the future. Until then, [let me know if you have any questions on twitter](https://twitter.com/bllchmbrs) and happy RAGING :)."
