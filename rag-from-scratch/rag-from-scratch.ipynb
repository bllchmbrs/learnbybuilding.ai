    "# Building a RAG Application from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "All these vendors are trying to overcomplicate retrieval augmented generation (RAG). They're trying to inject different tools all over the place and make it more complicated than it needs to be. Let's change that.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is going to teach you how to build RAG applications from scratch. No fluff, no jargon, no libraries, just a simple step by step RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The High Level Components of a RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a collection of documents (formally called a corpus)\n",
    "2. An input from the user\n",
    "3. a similarity measure between the collection of documents and the user input\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it's that simple. \n",
    "\n",

    "2. Perform our similarity measure\n",
    "3. Post-process the user input and the fetched document(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "The post-processing is done with an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A note from the paper itself\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual RAG paper is obviously *the* resource. The problem is that it assumes a LOT of context. It's more complicated than we need it to be.\n",

I've written about that in the past (see [this post](https://billchambers.me/posts/tf-idf-explained-in-python) but the short answer is that the **jaccard similarity** is the intersection divided by the union of the \"sets\" of words.\n",

    "## Areas for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "If we go back to our diagream of the RAG application and think about what we've just built, we'll see various opportunities for improvement. These opportunities are where tools like vector stores, embeddings, and prompt 'engineering' gets involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 10 potential areas for improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The number of documents** ðŸ‘‰ more documents might mean more recommendations.\n",
    "2. **The depth/size of documents** ðŸ‘‰ higher quality content and longer documents with more information might be better.\n",
    "3. **The number of documents we give to the LLM** ðŸ‘‰ Right now, we're only giving the LLM one document. We could feed in several as 'context' and allow the model to provide a more personalized recommendation based on the user input.\n",
    "4. **The parts of documents that we give to the LLM** ðŸ‘‰ If we have bigger or more thorough documents, we might just want to add in parts of those documents, parts of various documents, or some variation there of. In the lexicon, this is called chunking.\n",
    "5. **Our document storage tool** ðŸ‘‰ We might store our documents in a different way or different database. In particular, if we have a lot of documents, we might explore storing them in a data lake or a vector store.\n",
    "6. **The similarity measure** ðŸ‘‰ How we measure similarity is of consequence, we might need to trade off performance and thoroughness (e.g., looking at every individual document).\n",
    "7. **The pre-processing of the documents & user input** ðŸ‘‰ We might perform some extra preprocessing or augmentation of the user input before we pass it into the similarity measure. For instance, we might use an embedding to convert that input to a vector.\n",
    "8. **The similarity measure** ðŸ‘‰ We can change the similarity measure to fetch better or more relevant documents.\n",
    "9. **The model** ðŸ‘‰ We can change the final model that we use. We're using llama2 above, but we could just as easily use an Anthropic or Claude Model.\n",
    "10. **The prompt** ðŸ‘‰ We could use a different prompt into the LLM/Model and tune it according to the output we want to get the output we want.\n",
    "11. **If you're worried about harmful or toxic output** ðŸ‘‰ We could implement a \"circuit breaker\" of sorts that runs the user input to see if there's toxic, harmful, or dangerous discussions. For instance, in a healthcare context you could see if the information contained unsafe languages and respond accordingly - outside of the typical flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now improvements don't stop here. They're quite limitless and that's what we'll get into in the future. Until then, [let me know if you have any questions on twitter](https://twitter.com/bllchmbrs) and happy RAGING :)."
